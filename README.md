CRUD Operations with ASP.NET Framework and Swagger UI
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using ASP.NET Framework. It is designed to provide a seamless experience for working with APIs and integrates Swagger UI to enable testing and visualization of endpoints directly in the browser.

Features
Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality for managing entities.
Fully integrated Swagger UI for API documentation and endpoint testing.
Structured project architecture using:
Controllers for handling HTTP requests.
Data Access Layer (DAL) with Entity Framework for database operations.
Business Layer for encapsulating application logic.
Support for RESTful APIs with clear HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Built with clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
Technologies Used
ASP.NET Framework: For building the backend.
Entity Framework: For database interaction.
Swagger (Swashbuckle): For API testing and documentation.
SQL Server: As the database provider.
Dependency Injection: Simplified with Autofac for managing services.
